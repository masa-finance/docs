# Introduction

## A quick introduction to building on Base Goerli with Masa

*Video - get started with Masa in 3 minutes*

Letâ€™s test using Masa on the [Base Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.basescan.org/) where you will mint a Masa Green 2FA Self Sovereign SBT which is a 2FA SBT that verifies that the holder is a not bot through a phone OTP verification. The Quickstart will take you through minting a Masa Green 2FA SBT in a few easy steps. Using the Masa CLI and before you know it you will have minted a Masa Green SBT you will have verified you are not a bot!

> In order to complete the Quickstart you will must first get some Base Goerli ETH from a faucet such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet) or [Quicknode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/goerli).
> 

## Quickstart setup

Once you have some Base Goerli ETH in you wallet you will need to install the latest version of the Masa CLI.
